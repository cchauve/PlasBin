# Plasmids-Optimization
This repository contains the details and experimental results of the Plasmid MILP tool. It also contains the results of five other methods designed for plasmid binning and assembly. These methods include HyAsP, MOB-recon, plasmidSPAdes, gplas and SCAPP.

# Data
We use the data set from Robertson and Nash, 2018 (previously used for the HyAsP experiments). The data set contains 133 bacterial samples. As some of the methods we use are reference-based, we split this data set into two parts - a reference set and a test set. We carry out our experiments on the test set consisting of 66 of the 133 samples.
