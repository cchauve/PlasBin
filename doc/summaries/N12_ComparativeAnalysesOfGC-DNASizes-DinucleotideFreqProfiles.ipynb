    "This trend is noticed in more than 80% of bacterial and archaeal chromosomes-plasmids pairs. In most cases, the difference was less than 10%. The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0.965 and 0.917 in the respective cases. \n",

    "This was a short paper emphasizing the relation between the GC% of plasmids and chromosomes. The data set considered by the author is not as large as the one in the paper by Shintani et al. However, it arrives to the same conclusions. There is sufficient statistical evidence for the assumption that the GC% of chromosomes exceeds that of plasmids.\n",
